# POSIX-Practicas
Implementation of three separated utilities (merge_files, mystrings, split_files) that can be executed together using pipes (merge_mystrings_split).
merge_files: merges a maximum of 16 files into an output file or the standard output device.
mystrings: reads from the standard input device and prints in the standard output device all the printable characters.
split_files: reads from the standard input device and writes the nth byte in the nth output file and repeats this process until it reads all the standard input device.
